## Run Locally

**Prerequisites:**  Node.js


1. Install dependencies:
   `npm install`
2. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and set your API keys:
   - `VITE_API_KEY` - Your Gemini API key (Required - for AI chat and voice functionality)
     - Get your key from: https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey
   - `VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY` - Your OpenAI API key (Optional - for enhanced TTS voice)
     - Get your key from: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
     - If not set, will use Gemini TTS (Kore voice) instead
   - `VITE_MAPBOX_API_KEY` - Your Mapbox API key (Required for address verification and autocomplete)
     - Get your key from: https://account.mapbox.com/access-tokens/
     - Create a free account and get your public access token
3. Run the app:
   `npm run dev`

## Google Maps Address Autocomplete

The address autocomplete feature requires a Google Maps API key with the Places API enabled. If the API key is not set, you can still enter addresses manually. Check the browser console (F12) for debugging information about the API key status.
